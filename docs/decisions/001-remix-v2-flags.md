## Context

https://remix.run/blog/future-flags

Remix uses future flags to ease the v2 transition. 

All v2 APIs and behaviors are available in v1 with Future Flags. They can be enabled one at a time to avoid development disruption of your project. After you have enabled all flags, upgrading to v2 should be a non-breaking upgrade.


## Decision

We'll aggressively update the template to be turnkey ready for Remix v2. 

## Consequences

Breaking changes to the RePay will be introduced earlier than it has to be, may make existing projects to maintain parity with the template.
